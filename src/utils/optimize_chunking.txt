Goal of Chunking Optimization
To create document chunks that are semantically meaningful, contextually complete, and aligned with the natural structure of legal documents. 
This means one chunk per legal section (e.g., "Section 50: Rights of arrested persons") or chapter.

Why Generic Chunking is Suboptimal
  - Context Loss: A 500-character chunk might cut off the end of a section, losing critical context.
  - Poor Retrieval: The re-ranker and LLM receive incomplete information, leading to lower-quality answers.
  - Inefficient Re-ranking: The re-ranker has to process many small, potentially irrelevant snippets.
The Solution: Chapter-Level Chunking
  -Instead of splitting text by character count, use the inherent structure of the law (Chapters, Sections, Subsections) to define chunks.
